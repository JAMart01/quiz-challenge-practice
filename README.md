##2 What I did

Created a basic quiz game that uses window confirm to check for true and false. 
The browser will alert you if you got the answer correct. 
Once the game is over you score is tallied and you will receive a unique alert based on how many questions you got correct. 
---
If you get 4 or less correct your alert will say "Better luck next time!"
If you get 6 correct your alert will say "Your color knowledge is pretty decent!"
If you get all 8 correct your alert will say " That's 100%. You're a color master!"
